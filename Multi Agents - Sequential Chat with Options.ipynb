He was grunting and groaning and basically making noises that would make a moose blush. I thought, \"Wow, that's impressive.\" Then he dropped the weight, yelled \"Pizza time!\" and ran for the door. I'm thinking, \"Okay, maybe he was just bulking for the delivery guy?\" What's your take on that, Joe? Performance art or just a really dedicated carb-loader?\n",

You got the guys who are just there to check themselves out in the mirror, the women who are so serious about their treadmills they look like they're running from the apocalypse, and then you got this guy. He's the wild card. He's the reason I keep my gym bag stocked with a spare t-shirt... just in case he decides \"Ice cream time!\" next.\n",

      "Seriously though, \"Pizza Time!\" I'm stealing that. That's going to be my new motivational phrase. \"Joe, you got a show tonight? Pizza Time!\" \"Joe, you gotta do laundry? Pizza Time!\" It works for everything! I should probably just have a pizza delivered right now... for inspiration.\n",

The inevitable heat death of the universe?\n",
